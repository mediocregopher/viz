# Viz

An ongoing project to generate visuals using [quil](https://quil.info) and
clojurescript.

The project is being structured as a series of standalone visualizations, each
based on the previous but separate from it. The current master of this repo
represents the next visualization being developed.

Compiling should be as easy as `lein cljsbuild once`, and then hitting
index.html in a browser. You can go back in time to any tagged release to try it
locally.

https://blog.mediocregopher.com/2018/11/12/viz-1.html is the logical starting
point if you just want to look at the visuals, incrementing the number to reach
each subsequent one.
