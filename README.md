# Viz

An ongoing project to generate visuals using [quil](https://quil.info) and
clojurescript.

The project is being structured as a series of standalone vizualizations, each
based on the previous but separate from it. The current master of this repo
represents the next vizualization being developed.

Compiling should be as easy as `lein cljsbuild once`, and then hitting
index.html in a browser. You can go back in time to any tagged release to try it
locally.

https://mediocregopher.com/viz/1 is the logical starting point if you just want
to look at the visuals, incrementing the number to reach each subsequent one.
